# PyGame AI Tic Tac Toe

In this repo, I follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk9hlNZc6sE) to implement a working minimax algorithm in a Tic Tac Toe game using python and pygame, as a part of project research.

Note that this game provides feedback via the terminal during game play, so please be sure to check it out!

## Key Map:

Any of these key commands can be used during game play.

- ` r ` = Reset Game.
- ` g ` = Change Game Mode: Toggle AI Opponent on or off for a 2 human player game.
- ` 0 ` = Change Game Mode to random opponent square selection.
- ` 1 ` = Change Game Mode to Minimax AI opponent.
